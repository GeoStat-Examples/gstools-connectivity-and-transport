# Impact of connectivity on contaminant transport

Here we investigate the impact of different types of transmissivity
connectivity on contaminant transport.

To generate heterogeneous transmissivity fields with connected high and
low regions, we make use of the transformation presented by Zinn & Harvey:

## Structure

The workflow is organized by the following structure:
- `src/`
  - `00_tracer_test_conn.py` - field generation and transport simulation
  - `01_plot.py` - detailed analysis plot
  - `02_plot.py` - simple analysis plot
- `results/` - all produced results


## Python environment

Main Python dependencies are stored in `requirements.txt`:
```
gstools==1.3.1
ogs5py=1.1.1
matplotlib
```
